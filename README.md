# stories_test_didry

I chose to use SwiftUI with an MVVM pattern and Combine. I haven't added any ViewModel to the StoryView for the moment because it's too simple to need one.

The main problem I'm facing is with my data management. I don't know why yet, but I cannot update the like status of a story. I don't have enough time to investigate where the problem is.
